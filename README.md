# Text-classification
Text classification is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. It’s one of the
fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling,
spam detection, and intent detection.

Unstructured data in the form of text is everywhere: emails, chats, web pages, social media, support tickets, survey responses,
and more. Text can be an extremely rich source of information, but extracting insights from it can be hard and time-consuming 
due to its unstructured nature. Businesses are turning to text classification for structuring text in a fast and cost-efficient
way to enhance decision-making and automate processes.

# Support vector machine(SVM)
“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression 
challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in 
n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.
Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well
